## Introduction

FUI stands for Framebuffer User Interface. It is designed for developers who want to create user interfaces that run directly on framebuffer devices. This can be particularly useful for embedded systems, low-level programming, or projects where a graphical user interface is required without the overhead of a full desktop environment.

### Why FUI?

FUI provides a lightweight solution for rendering text and graphics directly to the framebuffer. It is efficient and allows for quick rendering of UI components. The goal is to provide a simple, easy-to-use interface that enables developers to focus on functionality rather than the intricacies of graphics programming.

## Features

- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal resource usage makes it ideal for embedded systems.
- **Direct Framebuffer Access**: Interact directly with framebuffer devices for quick rendering.
- **Customizable Components**: Easily create and modify UI components to fit your needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on various Linux-based systems.
- **Simple API**: Easy to learn and integrate into existing projects.

## Installation

To get started with FUI, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ahmadsailpil/fui/releases). Download the appropriate package for your system and follow the installation instructions included in the package.

1. **Download the Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ahmadsailpil/fui/releases) to find the latest version.
2. **Extract the Files**: Use your preferred extraction tool to unpack the downloaded file.
3. **Run the Installer**: Follow the instructions in the README file included in the package to complete the installation.

## Usage

Once you have installed FUI, you can start building your user interface. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```c
#include "fui.h"

int main() {
    fui_init(); // Initialize FUI
    fui_draw_text(10, 10, "Hello, FUI!"); // Draw text on the screen
    fui_render(); // Render the UI
    fui_cleanup(); // Clean up resources
    return 0;
}
```

### Example Application

To demonstrate the capabilities of FUI, you can build a simple application that displays a menu. This application will allow users to navigate through options using keyboard input.

1. **Initialize the FUI**: Start by initializing the library.
2. **Create Menu Options**: Define your menu options as strings.
3. **Render the Menu**: Use FUI functions to display the menu on the screen.
4. **Handle Input**: Capture keyboard input to navigate through the menu.
